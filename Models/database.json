      "author": "fatima zahrae",
      "description": "If you are a product developer, you may be thinking of moving into the the Woo ecosystem. You may be starting a plugin or extension or have already built it. Maybe you are looking at a big player in the space to acquire it. Or reselling on the WooCommerce marketplace. Here are three good places to start.",
      "blogDetails": "Make Your Product Compelling\r\nWhat is compelling about a product is when it’s really created with customer need in mind. Less breath, and more depth. By that have it focus on this one problem and just really introduce an elegant, simple, easy solution that reflects and understanding of the customer’s true need.\r\n\r\nEveryone has seen products out there, plugins, extensions, consumer products that are just patched together, modified from one thing to suit a different need. What is important is the thing that you’re creating really does meet a real need in the market.\r\n\r\nIntroduce an Elegant Solution\r\nThis is looking at it from the customer perspective and not from a coding or development standpoint If the store owner uses your plugin , they want to with minimal guidance and to be able to feel confident in their use of it. That is the bigger picture.\r\n\r\nThis may not be feasible depending on the level of complexity of the problem that you’re trying to solve. But it can be bolstered by really great docs, videos, and how to’s. With Google these days, people can find guidance out there. If they are using something and it’s intuitive or it’s adapting to their skill level or needs, that is really beautiful.\r\n\r\nWinning Hearts with Reviews\r\nIt’s not always about market share or numbers. It’s also about winning the hearts of those that you’re trying to serve. So the amount of passion that comes through reviews should reflect a love for a brand, or the story about “hey, it really made my work a lot easier,” or “It boosted my sales by 40 percent,” or, “it changed how I think about my business, and it changed the opportunity for me.”\r\n\r\nThese are just three examples that were shared with from Clara Lee who leads product marketing at WooCommerce.com. She has a lot of insights she shares more behind the scenes via marketing the WooCommerce marketplace and other products. You can listen to the full podcast. Or if you would like to hear my perspective on breaking into the Woo ecosystem, I have a few thoughts as well.",

      "author": "Hicham",
      "description": "Freelancing is not for the weak-hearted. It takes a lot of grit, empathy and courage. Some who choose that path wouldn’t have it any other way. There are opportunities they are given that would not have been the same if they were working for a company or an agency. And although you might be thinking that the freedom alone is one of the strong points, when it comes to what really sets apart a good freelancer if beyond that creative drive.",
      "blogDetails": "The Super Power of Building Relationships\r\nA lot of developers start their career opening an agency. You spend your time trying to gain clients, trying to provide solutions, running after different projects. But for some freelancing is the best route. Whether it’s yourself, or you work for a company like Codeable, it provides the best way to get the kind of clients you want. Ideally, those who are respectful, and they appreciate your work, and they return to you and you build a relationship with them.\r\n\r\nWhat many developers have admired the most about the freelancing is the relationship that you can build with clients.\r\n\r\nFreelancing Gives You the Ability to Communication with Clients\r\nWith the ability to communicate with clients, to express yourself, to even talk about technical stuff and not only the technical stuff. All of that together makes it much more sense to as a human being and as a system solver or provider, to work with clients than any other way.\r\n\r\nWhat sets a good freelancer apart is the ability to build relationships. It’s never about what that customer needs now or what that customer might need now, it’s about supplying them with what they need now in such a manner that they are always going to come back to you for it. You are their trusted partner in this journey that they are making with their website, and they will always come back to you. It’s about establishing those relationships in very solid manner. And it’s about the small things. It’s about saying, please, thank you, or remembering them on a holiday and saying, “Hey, happy holiday.” It’s the little things that make it.\r\n\r\nThe Hardest Part is the Soft Stuff, Not the Technical Stuff.\r\nAs a result, what sets a really amazing freelancer apart from ones that tackle the hardest part, the soft skills. That’s the most difficult part to really tone down.\r\n\r\nThe technical stuff you can learn in a book. Saying it’s not hard I suppose is reductive. But you’re capable of learning it with ease, there’s a structure to it. The soft stuff is the harder piece of it.",

      "title": "What Storytelling Means to a WooCommerce Product Builder",
      "author": "fatima zahrae",
      "description": "Abha Thakor, co-host on my podcast Do the Woo, has been bringing on guests to tell stories since she joined our team. Before she did that, she was a guest herself and took the time to explain why storytelling is such an important part of being a builder.",
      "blogDetails": "The reason behind storytelling\r\nI get really exasperated when people tell me in a professional environment, “Oh, we do storytelling” when this storytelling is basically nothing about the person or capturing what it is that it means to them. And it is just a corporately-engineered line. Some corporate blurb that has nothing about the real person or people involved. Storytelling has been around for thousands of years, the only difference is the tools that we use. A story, to be effective, has to have certain components to help people understand that story, to reach others, and for them to be moved or inspired by that story.\r\n\r\nThat doesn’t mean that they should create stuff that’s not there. This is one of the things that I would really say to WooCommerce businesses, please don’t create stories that aren’t true. If you change people’s stories or what they share in reviews to fit your corporate brief or what you’re trying to sell, they will come back about it and they will not work with you again. They will also be a lost customer.\r\n\r\nAnd actually, you don’t need to approach it like that because the story they’ve told you is the one which will inspire somebody else. Storytelling needs to be something that is positive, it needs to have an integrity to it. It also needs to avoid being translated into words that actually people will not understand. People don’t relate to that, people relate to people.\r\n\r\nWhat storytelling means to a product builder\r\nThe best stories are often going to be the people who write to you and give you a particularly strong review, saying why it made a difference. Now, don’t just use their review and run it as a promotion with all your branding around it. Talk to the person. Because talking to the person will give you more of the context of that story. That story itself is likely to be more powerful. You have empowered the person and the customer, you’ve made them feel valued, which is important because this customer has taken time to contact you. It is often so easy to give a negative review. In our culture, sadly, people will not jump to pay a compliment. Value that customer who does and help them share their story.\r\n\r\nThe Royal National Lifeboat Institution is a really good example. They are a charity in the UK and Ireland, and like many other organizations, they monitor what is happening. They monitor what is being said. But they don’t just take it, reproduce them and say, “Hey, this is all about us.” What they do is actually something that is the same for what you would do for a product.\r\n\r\nIt’s, “Let’s talk to this person, let’s see what the context is. Let’s see what else they might want to say.” It may be that they want to share more. If you don’t have the conversation, you could have just missed out on the best story, something that will not only interest your audience, but will also motivate your team or staff.\r\n\r\nStories can also come from other sources and interactions with your customers. Encourage your team to look out for how to help build your community.\r\n\r\nThe story brings trust for newcomers to WooCommerce\r\nWe often say to one of the WooCommerce agencies we work with, “Okay, if you are working with a charity or you are sponsoring something because you passionately believe in it, what are you want to say about that?” And not from the perspective of making money off that charity or making money off that cause. But what is it that is part of your story? Because actually telling your story is more than telling the public that you sponsored something.\r\n\r\nAnd I’ve seen it with WooCommerce builders. I’ve dealt with a couple of sites recently that they’ve sent me. [These sites in their version of stories]  literally talked about what they had in their toothpaste and when they brushed their teeth, what came out of their teeth. And “Why would people want to know this?”\r\n\r\nIt was because the teams looked at social media where people talked about breakfast and things like that. They didn’t know where to start, so, that’s what they did too. I have got permission to re-tell that story because the team there said, “Someone should have told us this.”\r\n\r\nBut it’s telling your story and telling what you are comfortable with sharing. I’m one of the editors of the People of WordPress series. And we’ve interviewed lots of people who are from e-commerce, but hear them say, “Okay, what are you happy to be reading about yourself? What are you going to be happy about someone talking to you about? Is really important and that’s for any person.\r\n\r\nIt’s about being listened to and heard\r\nAnd that’s the joy for me, coming from a PR background where I’m a Chartered PR Practitioner and that’s a lot about actually thinking about the ethics of communication and how we deal with things in a positive way and how we involve people. We don’t do communications to them, we create or we do communications together because it’s about being listened to and being heard. And helping people be listened to and heard is the greatest way to do that.\r\n\r\nWe talk about ownership a lot. So if I was talking to you as a product developer, I would say, “Okay, share a little bit about what that means in terms of why it’s special to you, how and why it excites you,” because that is your story. And that may be what you invite other people to share as well.\r\n\r\nFor example, with the boats work that we do, we ask the captains to share what it is that they love about taking people on these wonderful excursions. And it becomes much more than this e-commerce thing that you’re supposed to do. It becomes a living and breathing part of your business and part of your organization. And that is when business really innovates, it’s when you get fantastic solutions, it’s where you meet and collaborate with other people. And more importantly, you get to meet exciting customers that makes day with you for the rest of your business career. And that’s the people that you want to be at your party when you retire. So, it’s bringing that locality back to you, really.",

      "title": "Thoughts on Translating the WooCommerce Plugin",
      "author": "Aymane",
      "description": "Last year on a podcast host Abha Thakor had a chat with three Woo builders as they shared their stories around translation, meetups and sustainability. It’s great to reflect on past conversations as we need to keep these important elements of WooCommerce moving forward.",
      "blogDetails": "Translating WooCommerce as a plugin into your local language\r\nWhen it comes to the WooCommerce plugin, there are thoughts around the importance of translating it into local languages. For example, Simon Kraft from Germany weighed in on this.\r\n\r\nHe started by stating that WooCommerce is similar to WordPress and any WordPress plugins because people often find their way around English strengths since English is the default in WooCommerce and many other plugins. But in cases like eCommerce, it’s very important to have that in your local language. This helps any user or developer to understand what you’re doing and find your way around a shop or a website. Luckily with WordPress there is a large community of volunteers pledging their time to translating enormous numbers of text to their local languages.\r\n\r\nTranslations in German\r\nWhen it comes to Simon’s native language, German, he noted that they are a bit picky with having strange language strings in their websites and WooCommerce shops are no exception to that. Years ago when he started translating WooCommerce, he would find wrong or misleading translation, something that was translated with some automated software like Google Translate, but was not precisely on point in German. At that point he thought, “Hmm, we can do better than that.” So Simon moved over to the translation side of things and tried to fix it and not break stuff on my way there.\r\n\r\nGetting started on translating the WooCommerce plugin\r\nVachan from India added how he started translating WooCommerce and how others can start. It started with his team and wanting to help the community. As a project translator the simplest way to do this is to go to the translation page on the WordPress official website. There you will be able to easily find what interests you in translation. Just select your language and you can select which project you want to work on. For WooCommerce, once you have chosen your language, search for it. There you will find a complete front end system where you can see what has been translated and what is pending.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, there are two primary places where you can help contribute to the translation. The first is the stable version, which is actually live and people are using it. Secondly, there’s a trunk, which is the future release, the immediate future release. Both are equally important because the current version helps whoever is already installed and working on that to ensure it gets updated whenever the user updates their website. And of course, the trunk is for the future release.\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say that working in both is a good idea. It’s about your fluency and how comfortable you are picking up any language. If you feel you’re confident enough to take any language, you can explore it. See what words, which phrases are requiring any translation and you can suggest that translation. And it’s as simple as just filling up that simple clicking on the word, clicking on that phrase and just in inputting your translated reply. That’s it.\r\n\r\nDo you need to be a WooCommerce developer?\r\nVachan does not feel you need to be a developer. You just need to understand WooCommerce enough and have used it. It’ll help you because you understand where that phrase is being used. Because in some languages, what happens with the same word could mean something differently, such as a different context. So just being aware of the context is a good thing. You don’t have to be an expert in development as there isn’t any coding language required. It’s just the language you know. And understanding the context of where that phrase is going to get used in the software is important.\r\n\r\nChallenges of translation\r\nEveryone on the podcast gave a bit of insight to the challenges not only met with WooCommerce translations, but WordPress as well. Maja gave one example of translating a certain term like tab or field. Once this is done and you translate to a new deposit, this word in the glossary. For instance, if the tab is being translated into my language, if you go and Google that word in my language, you will not find anything actually that explains how to solve your problem. So it would be great if there would be a visual supporting articles explaining this or expanding on the glossary.\r\n\r\nSimon, when revisiting translating German, added that here are cases where stuff like that happens. In German, it’s not so bad because German and English are quite close to a certain degree. The main issue with German is that German words are very long in many cases. Because in German it’s grammatically sane to just chain words and have like donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftsmützenfabrikant. That’s a valid word. It’s about a hat for a sea captain.\r\n\r\nSo in many, many cases, it’s actually an issue to find a translation that fits the context. For example, you have a button somewhere and the button cannot be huge. So you have to find a fitting word that meets the context. That’s hard sometimes.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to WooCommerce or any eCommerce context, translating with localizing the currency is important. WooCommerce, which is America-focused in many cases, we have examples in U.S. Dollars and similar currencies, which is perfectly fine. But if we translated for the German or European market, then we would replace those examples with Euros or Pound or whatever.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n\r\nThe overall conversation carried a theme as first mentioned. It is important for WooCommerce builders, who have the resources and capabilities, to get involved with helping to translate the WooCommerce plugin. From what I have seen, the growth of Woo is building in countries across the world and here at Do the Woo we want to help you to bring your translating skills to help that growth.",

      "author": "Reemenas",
      "description": "I had this post over on Do the Woo and felt it needed to come back home to BobWP.",
      "blogDetails": "So without further ado….\r\n\r\nBack when WordPress 4.0 came out I did an experiment. I installed and activated 100 plugins on two test sites, including WooCommerce. I did this primarily so see if I could get away with a one-click update without getting the white screen of death.\r\n\r\nIt was an old post, and had since been deleted. Maybe because I didn’t want to encourage anyone to actually do this. But whatever the case, in fall of last year two of my good friends on Twitter asked me about this deleted post.\r\n\r\nAt that time I searched on my backup drive and lo and behold, yes, I did save all those videos. I posted here, on my older BobWP.com and everyone, at least the two of them, were happy. Since then I had updated and deleted all those olds posts. And like a bad penny, it’s back.\r\n\r\nOne note I should make. I did not go through in the end and see if all 100 were completely functional. My test was simply to see if the look of the site would change much or if I would get the dreaded white screen of death.\r\n\r\nIt’s short.. so take a step back in time and see if the entire universe exploded or not.",
